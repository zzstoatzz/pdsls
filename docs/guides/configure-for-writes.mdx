title: "Configure pdsx for Writes"
description: "Set up authentication to create, update, and delete records"
---

reading public records with `-r` doesn't require authentication, but any write operations (create, update, delete) need credentials.

## install pdsx

```bash
# one-time use
uvx pdsx --help

# add to project
uv add pdsx
```

## obtain an app password

go to Bluesky settings → App Passwords and create a new one. format: `xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx`

use the app password, not your account password.

## configure credentials

### environment variables

```bash
export ATPROTO_HANDLE=your.handle.bsky.social
export ATPROTO_PASSWORD=xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx
```

or create a `.env` file (add to `.gitignore`):

```bash
ATPROTO_HANDLE=your.handle.bsky.social
ATPROTO_PASSWORD=xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx
```

### command-line flags

```bash
pdsx --handle your.handle --password xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx create ...
```

## verify authentication

```bash
pdsx ls app.bsky.actor.profile
```

## use a test account

when learning pdsx, use a test Bluesky account to avoid modifying your main profile.
