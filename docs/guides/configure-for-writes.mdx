# configure pdsx for writes

reading public records with `-r` doesn't require authentication, but any write operations (create, update, delete) need credentials.

## install pdsx

```bash
# one-time use
uvx pdsx --help

# add to project
uv add pdsx
```

## obtain an app password

<Warning>
**Use an app password, not your account password**. App passwords have scoped permissions and can be revoked.
</Warning>

1. go to Bluesky settings → App Passwords
2. create new app password
3. copy the generated password (format: `xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx`)
4. store it securely (you won't see it again)

## configure credentials

### option 1: environment variables (recommended)

create a `.env` file in your project:

```bash
ATPROTO_HANDLE=your.handle.bsky.social
ATPROTO_PASSWORD=xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx
```

<Warning>
**Add `.env` to `.gitignore`** to prevent committing credentials to version control.
</Warning>

### option 2: shell rc file

add to `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
export ATPROTO_HANDLE=your.handle.bsky.social
export ATPROTO_PASSWORD=xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx
```

### option 3: command-line flags

```bash
pdsx --handle your.handle --password xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx create ...
```

not recommended for regular use (password appears in shell history).

## verify authentication

test that auth works by listing your own profile:

```bash
pdsx ls app.bsky.actor.profile
```

you should see your profile record with `description`, `displayName`, etc.

## use a test account

<Tip>
When learning pdsx, use a test account to avoid accidentally modifying your main profile.
</Tip>

create a throwaway Bluesky account for experimentation:
1. sign up at bsky.app with a test email
2. generate app password
3. use those credentials in pdsx

## troubleshooting

**error: "provide --handle/--password or set ATPROTO_HANDLE/ATPROTO_PASSWORD"**

authentication is required for this operation. set credentials via env vars or flags.

**authentication succeeds but operations fail**

verify you're using an app password (format `xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx`), not your account password.

**"invalid handle or password"**

- check handle format: `username.bsky.social` (not `@username`)
- verify app password is copied correctly (no extra spaces)
- ensure app password hasn't been revoked in Bluesky settings

## what's next

- [read any repository](/guides/read-repositories) - explore public data
- [create, update, delete safely](/guides/crud-safety) - write operations workflow
- [repositories concept](/concepts/repositories) - understand the auth model
