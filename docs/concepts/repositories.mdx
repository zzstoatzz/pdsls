# repositories

## what is a repository?

in atproto, a **repository** is a user's personal data store - a signed collection of records that represents everything that user has created. each account has exactly one repository.

think of it as:
- git repo, but for database records
- key-value store where keys are paths, values are records
- cryptographically signed (verifiable, tamper-evident)
- portable (can move between pds instances)

## where repositories live

repositories are hosted on **personal data servers (pds)**:

```
user account → repository → hosted on pds
```

the pds is just storage - it doesn't control the data:
- user owns the repository (has signing keys)
- user can migrate to different pds
- pds failure doesn't mean data loss (repositories are portable)

**pdsx talks directly to pds instances** to read/write records in repositories.

## repository structure

repositories organize records using a path-based structure:

```
<collection>/<rkey>
```

example paths:
```
app.bsky.feed.post/3jwdwj2ctlk26
app.bsky.actor.profile/self
app.bsky.graph.follow/3k2y5tqw7ml2r
```

### collections

collections group related records together:
- identified by nsid (namespaced id)
- all records of same type go in same collection
- examples: posts, likes, follows, profiles

collections are not arbitrary - they're defined by **lexicon schemas** that specify:
- what fields are required/optional
- what types those fields must be
- validation rules

### record keys (rkeys)

rkeys uniquely identify a record within its collection:
- most use tid (timestamp identifier) format
- some use fixed keys (`self` for profiles)
- chronologically sortable (tids)
- unique within collection

## merkle search tree (mst)

internally, repositories use a **merkle search tree**:

```
records → sorted by path → stored in mst → referenced by hash (cid)
```

why this matters for pdsx:
- **efficient listing**: records in same collection are adjacent
- **verifiable**: each commit has a hash, creates audit trail
- **deterministic**: same records = same tree structure

when you use `pdsx ls app.bsky.feed.post`, you're traversing this tree to enumerate records in that collection.

## repository commits

every change creates a signed commit:

```
change records → create new mst → sign commit → new cid
```

commits form a chain:
```
commit 1 → commit 2 → commit 3 (current)
```

**implications for pdsx**:
- writes create new commits
- repositories have full history
- commits are cryptographically signed (verifiable)

## did as repository identifier

each repository is identified by its owner's **did** (decentralized identifier):

```
at://did:plc:44ybard66vv44zksje25o7dz/app.bsky.feed.post/3jwdwj2ctlk26
      └────────────────────────────┘
               repository
```

the did:
- is permanent (doesn't change if user moves pds)
- controls the repository (has signing keys)
- resolves to pds location (via did document)

## authentication model

repository access has two modes:

### unauthenticated reads
anyone can read public records from any repository:

```bash
# no auth needed - reading someone else's public data
pdsx -r jlowin.dev ls app.bsky.feed.post
```

pdsx resolves the handle → did → pds location → fetches records

### authenticated writes
writing to a repository requires:
- handle + password
- creates session with pds
- session proves you control the did

```bash
# auth needed - writing to your own repository
export ATPROTO_HANDLE=your.handle
export ATPROTO_PASSWORD=your-password
pdsx create app.bsky.feed.post text='hello'
```

**why this design?**
- public data is public (no gatekeeping)
- private data stays private (auth required)
- users control their repositories (not the pds)

## cross-repository references

records can reference records in other repositories:

```json
{
  "$type": "app.bsky.feed.like",
  "subject": {
    "uri": "at://did:plc:other-user/app.bsky.feed.post/abc123",
    "cid": "bafyrei..."
  }
}
```

the reference includes:
- uri (which repository + collection + rkey)
- cid (content hash for verification)

this is a **strong reference** - includes hash to detect if referenced record changes.

## repository portability

repositories can move between pds instances:

1. export repository (all records + blobs)
2. update did document (point to new pds)
3. import to new pds
4. old pds becomes irrelevant

**pdsx doesn't care where repository is hosted** - it follows the did to find the current pds.

## how pdsx uses repositories

### reading records
```bash
pdsx -r user.handle ls collection
```

1. resolve handle → did
2. resolve did → pds url
3. fetch records from pds
4. return to user

### writing records
```bash
pdsx create collection field=value
```

1. authenticate with pds
2. construct record
3. submit to pds
4. pds updates repository mst
5. pds creates signed commit

### listing collections
```bash
pdsx ls app.bsky.feed.post
```

traverses mst to enumerate all records in that collection path

## federation model

atproto is federated:
- many pds instances
- each hosts many repositories
- users choose their pds
- repositories are portable

**pdsx is pds-agnostic** - works with any pds implementing the atproto spec:
- bsky.social (bluesky's pds)
- self-hosted pds
- third-party providers

## why understanding repositories matters

knowing the repository model helps you understand:

**why handles vs dids**: handles change, dids don't - use dids for durability

**why collections**: records are grouped by type for efficient access

**why authentication works this way**: reading public data doesn't need auth, writing does

**why records are portable**: repositories are user-owned, pds is just hosting

**why pdsx has the flags it does**: `-r` specifies which repository, `--pds` specifies which server
